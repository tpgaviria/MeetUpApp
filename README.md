A Web Broswer based app
- Input two addresses
- Map centers to midpoint between those two locations
- List of nearby businesses and their yelp rating populated
- Clicking on a business provides turn by turn directions from both originally input addresses
- Chat functionality

Technologies used:
- Geocoding API by Mapquest to convert address strings into latitude and longitude coordinates
- Yelp API for business and rating results
- Firebase's Firechat for chat and Google Authentication
- Leaflet / OpenStreetMaps for map, tile layer by CARTO
- Materialize for styling
- JQuery

Future features in development:
- Sign in / add friends using Firebase to store data
- Request to meet, send secret address on only display midpoint and directions from one location
- Yelp results option to filter by business type (ex. theatres, parks, etc)
- Directions - transportation mode options (car, walking, public transport, etc)
